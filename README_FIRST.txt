AcademicPages starter content
=============================

How to use:
1) First create your site by clicking "Use this template" on https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io
   and name it USERNAME.github.io (replace USERNAME).
2) Download this ZIP and unzip it somewhere on your computer.
3) Drag-and-drop the folders (like `_pages`, `_publications`, `_posts`, `_data`) into your new repo on GitHub
   (or commit/push via Git if you prefer). Allow it to overwrite placeholder files if prompted.
4) After you commit, GitHub Pages will rebuild and your changes will appear at https://USERNAME.github.io

What’s inside:
- `_config.yml`: minimal edits pre-filled with your name/email; adjust as needed.
- `_data/navigation.yml`: controls the top navigation menu.
- `_pages/about.md`: your About page.
- `_pages/cv.md`: a CV page that links to /files/CV_AndreaFerrara.pdf (replace with your own file).
- `_publications/`: one example publication file to copy.
- `_posts/`: a first "Hello" post so you can see the blog working.
- `files/`: put PDFs here (CV, papers). They’ll be served at /files/YourFile.pdf

Next steps after upload:
- Replace email, social links, and scholar IDs in `_config.yml`.
- Replace the text in `about.md` and `cv.md`.
- Add more files under `_publications` and `_posts` following the examples.
